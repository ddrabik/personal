        <div class="about-content">
          <p>
            My journey as a software engineer began in high school, self-taught through online resources, and extended into my time at UC San Diego. There, I engaged in various projects, from
            university department websites to mobile applications for local nonprofits, and interned in Sydney, applying software engineering to solve real-world problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Intuit, I leveraged AngularJS and Java to develop web applications enhancing security and productivity, streamlining authentication policies and API development processes. After Intuit,
            at Raise, I advanced our technology and team capabilities, from developing apps that broadened our market presence to leading the adoption of modern engineering practices like continuous
            development and GraphQL architecture. My focus on mentorship and process optimization significantly reduced onboarding times and strengthened our engineering culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Brex, I led transformative projects that enabled global financial transactions and streamlined accounting processes, significantly reducing FX fees and simplifying reimbursements for
            enterprise customers. My efforts to improve reliability through SLO Dashboards improved both customer and team on call experiences. Complementing these technical achievements, I focused on
            mentorship and team growth, enhancing our engineering capabilities through documentation, tool enhancements, and fostering a culture of operational excellence and continuous learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my wife and my hobbies, such as
            <a href="http://instagram.com/ddrabik/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nature and wildlife photography</a>, pottery, and
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wafflesandchip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cooking</a>.
